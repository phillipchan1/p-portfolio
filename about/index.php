				<h2>How I Work.</h2>
				<p class="big-text">
					Because time is money, an experienced developer cares about your time and how it pays you back.
				</p>
				<p>For this reason, I choose the approach that approaches challenges holistically upfront. I aim to real solve problems by talking, planning, and consulting before a single line of code is written. That way less time is wasted on iterations, mistakes, miscommunication and more time is spent getting value back to you.
